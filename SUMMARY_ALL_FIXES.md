# All Fixes Applied - Summary

## 3 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Wrong Model Name
**Before**: `nvidia/stt_en_fastconformer_hybrid_large_streaming_80ms` (doesn't exist!)
**After**: `nvidia/stt_en_fastconformer_hybrid_large_streaming_multi` ✅
**File**: `source-code/core/config.py:50`

### 2. ❌ VAD Blocking Streaming
**Before**: Only transcribed when VAD detected speech → breaks cache
**After**: Transcribe EVERY chunk → cache maintained ✅
**File**: `source-code/main.py:187`

### 3. ❌ Overly Aggressive Filter
**Before**: Filtered common words like "you", "okay", "thank you"
**After**: Only filters obvious hallucinations ✅
**File**: `source-code/core/transcription.py:24-29`

### 4. ✅ Better Logging Added
Now shows:
- `[RAW OUTPUT] 'text'` - What model produces
- `[FILTERED OUT] 'text'` - What got filtered
- `[FINAL] 'text'` - What reaches the UI

## Test Results

✅ Model loads correctly
✅ conformer_stream_step API available
✅ Audio is being captured (200-300 amplitude)
✅ Transcription runs without errors
✅ Hypothesis text extraction works

## Try Now

```bash
./jarvis.sh
```

With Netflix playing, you should see transcriptions in the UI!

## If Still No Words

Check the logs by enabling debug:
```bash
DEBUG_MODE=true ./jarvis.sh
```

Look for:
- `[RAW OUTPUT]` lines - does model produce anything?
- `[FILTERED OUT]` lines - is text being filtered?
- `Streaming transcription in Xms | Raw: ''` - model returning empty?

## Possible Remaining Issues

1. **Model quality**: FastConformer might not recognize all audio perfectly
2. **Audio quality**: Mic picking up Netflix but with noise/distortion
3. **Language**: Model is English-only, won't work for other languages
4. **CPU mode**: Running on CPU is slower, might miss quick speech
