# Filter Fix - Common Words No Longer Blocked!

## The Problem

The **hallucination filter was filtering out common words**!

### Overly Aggressive Filter (BEFORE)
```python
HALLUCINATION_PHRASES = {
    'thank you', 'thanks for watching', 'please subscribe',
    'you', 'uh', 'um', 'ah', 'mm', 'hmm',  # ‚Üê "you" blocked!
    '.', '...', 'okay', 'ok'                # ‚Üê "okay" blocked!
}
```

**Result**: If Netflix said "you" or "okay" or "thank you" ‚Üí **FILTERED OUT** ‚Üí You saw nothing!

## The Fix

### Minimal Filter (AFTER)
```python
HALLUCINATION_PHRASES = {
    'thanks for watching', 'please subscribe',  # YouTube-specific
    'uh', 'um', 'ah', 'mm', 'hmm',             # Filler sounds only
    '.', '...'                                  # Punctuation only
    # Removed: 'you', 'okay', 'ok', 'thank you' - REAL WORDS!
}
```

**Result**: Only obvious hallucinations filtered, real words pass through! ‚úÖ

## New Logging

Added detailed logging to see exactly what's happening:

```
[RAW OUTPUT] 'hello world' (145ms)    ‚Üê Model produced this
‚úì Accepted: 'hello world'             ‚Üê Passed all filters
[FINAL] 'hello world'                 ‚Üê Sent to UI

[RAW OUTPUT] 'um' (132ms)             ‚Üê Model produced filler
Filtered hallucination: 'um'          ‚Üê Correctly filtered
[FILTERED OUT] 'um' was filtered      ‚Üê Warning that we filtered it
```

## What Changed

| Text | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| "hello world" | ‚úÖ Pass | ‚úÖ Pass |
| "you" | ‚ùå BLOCKED! | ‚úÖ Pass |
| "okay" | ‚ùå BLOCKED! | ‚úÖ Pass |
| "thank you" | ‚ùå BLOCKED! | ‚úÖ Pass |
| "um" | ‚ùå Blocked | ‚ùå Blocked (correct) |
| "thanks for watching" | ‚ùå Blocked | ‚ùå Blocked (correct) |

## All Fixes Applied

### 1. Model Name ‚úÖ
- Was: `stt_en_fastconformer_hybrid_large_streaming_80ms` (doesn't exist)
- Now: `stt_en_fastconformer_hybrid_large_streaming_multi`

### 2. Hypothesis Extraction ‚úÖ
- Now extracts `.text` properly from Hypothesis objects

### 3. VAD Removed ‚úÖ
- Processes ALL chunks (streaming needs continuous cache)

### 4. Filter Fixed ‚úÖ
- Removed common words from blacklist
- Only filters obvious hallucinations

## Test Now!

```bash
./jarvis.sh
```

**Play Netflix and watch for these log messages:**

```
[RAW OUTPUT] 'the quick brown fox' (142ms)
‚úì Accepted: 'the quick brown fox'
[FINAL] 'the quick brown fox'
```

You should now see actual transcriptions! üéâ

## Debug Mode

To see ALL the details:
```bash
DEBUG_MODE=true ./jarvis.sh
```

This will show:
- Every chunk being processed
- Raw model output
- What gets filtered and why
- What makes it through
